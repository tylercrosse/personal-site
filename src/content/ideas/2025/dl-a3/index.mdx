## TL;DR
Assignment 3 compressed the semester’s sequential modeling content into one deliverable: theory work on RNN backprop, LSTM implementations from scratch, a Seq2Seq translator with cosine-similarity attention, and both lightweight and full Transformers. The tasks culminated in benchmarking German→English translation quality (perplexity + BLEU) before and after hyperparameter tuning.

## Key moves
- Derived $\partial L / \partial U$ for a length-3 RNN, matching the provided computation-graph derivation and reinforcing how vanishing gradients appear in practice.
- Implemented an LSTM cell, Seq2Seq encoder/decoder with attention, and a one-layer Transformer encoder manually (multi-head attention, feed-forward, residual + LayerNorm), then contrasted them with PyTorch’s built-in `nn.Transformer`.
- Tuned embedding size, hidden width, teacher forcing ratio, and label smoothing to push the Transformer’s perplexity below the Seq2Seq baseline while reducing exposure bias.

## Representative equation
The custom attention module followed a cosine-similarity variant of Bahdanau attention:

$$
\alpha_t = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q_t k_s^\top}{\|q_t\|\,\|k_s\|}\right), \qquad c_t = \sum_s \alpha_{t,s} v_s,
$$

where $q_t$ is the decoder query, $k_s$ encoder keys, and $v_s$ encoder values. Feeding $[c_t; h_t]$ through a linear layer noticeably improved rare-word recall.
