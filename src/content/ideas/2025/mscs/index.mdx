In Spring 2024, I embarked on a new chapter: pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Tech. This might seem like a natural step for a software engineer, but my path has been anything but conventional. My undergraduate degree is in Biomedical Engineering, a field that, at first glance, seems worlds away from kernels and compilers.

My motivation to return to academia was sparked in 2018 with the release of [AlphaFold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold). As a professional developer since 2014, I had built everything from small web apps to large-scale distributed systems. Yet, AlphaFold's success crystallized two things for me: first, machine learning was poised to revolutionize science in ways I hadn't imagined, and second, my day-to-day work wasn't giving me the depth I craved to be a part of that revolution. I realized that to truly understand and contribute to the field, I needed the kind of rigorous, foundational knowledge that only an academic program could provide.

## My Coursework

My plan is to tailor my studies around two specializations: Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing. Here's a look at my journey through the curriculum. I'll link out to more detailed posts on each course and project as I complete them.

üå± Spring 2024:
  - [CS 6200: Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems (GIOS)](/ideas/2025/gios-retro/)
    - [Project 1: Simple File System](/ideas/2025/gios-pr1/)
    - There was no project 2 the semester I took it.
    - [Project 3: Proxy and Cache](/ideas/2025/gios-pr3/)
    - [Project 4: Distributed File System](/ideas/2025/gios-pr4/)

üåª Summer 2024:

After a demanding first semester, I took a three-month sabbatical to travel through Europe, returning refreshed and ready for the next challenge.
