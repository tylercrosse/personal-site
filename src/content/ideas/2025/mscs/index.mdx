I started my Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) journey at Georgia Tech in Spring 2024. In undergrad I studied Biomedical Engineering.

My initial motivation started with the release of [Alpha Fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold) in 2018. This kicked off two major threads for me.

1. It was clear that the field of machine learning had broad implications for science beyond just building better computer systems. 
2. My current work as an application developer was not providing me with the opportunity to learn about the field.

I started programming full-time in 2014. I've been working in the field ever since. I've worked on a variety of projects, from small web apps to large scale distributed systems. I've also worked on a variety of languages, from C to Python to JavaScript.

Machine learning is field that benefits from academic rigor.

## Coursework

My plan is to write a post for each course I take. I'll link to the posts here as I write them.
