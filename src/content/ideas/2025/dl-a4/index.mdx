## TL;DR
Assignment 4 was a tour through three generative paradigms. I implemented and trained a variational autoencoder (VAE), DCGAN-style adversarial model, and a lightweight diffusion model, running each on MNIST and FashionMNIST. The shared trainer infrastructure meant I could isolate the effect of latent dimensionality, discriminator updates, or diffusion noise schedules without rewriting boilerplate.

## Highlights
- Verified the reparameterization trick and KL annealing in the VAE to stabilize reconstructions while keeping disentangled latent traversals.
- Implemented GAN training loops with alternating generator/discriminator steps, label smoothing, and gradient clipping to tame early-mode collapse on FashionMNIST coats/bags.
- Built a DDPM from scratch: linear $\beta_t$ schedule, cached $\alpha_t$/$\bar{\alpha}_t$, forward diffusion sampler, UNet noise predictor, and reverse-time sampling to produce crisp samples with competitive FID for such a small model.

## Representative equations
Both the probabilistic and diffusion perspectives were front and center:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z|x)}[\log p_\theta(x|z)] - D_{\text{KL}}\big(q_\phi(z|x) \parallel p(z)\big),
$$

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\, x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\,\epsilon, \qquad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I),
$$

followed by a learned denoiser $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$ for the reverse process.
