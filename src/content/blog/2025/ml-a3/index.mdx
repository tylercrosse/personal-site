## Introduction

This project is an exploration of unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms and to provide a recommendation for the best algorithm for a given dataset.

The project is implemented in Python and uses the scikit-learn library. The project is divided into two parts:

1. A comparative analysis of unsupervised learning techniques.
2. A recommendation for the best algorithm for a given dataset.
