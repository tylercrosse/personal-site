## Introduction

This project is a comparative analysis of supervised learning algorithms on diverse datasets. The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms and to provide a recommendation for the best algorithm for a given dataset.

The project is implemented in Python and uses the scikit-learn library. The project is divided into two parts:

1. A comparative analysis of supervised learning algorithms on diverse datasets.
2. A recommendation for the best algorithm for a given dataset.
