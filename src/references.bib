  abstract = {Back in the mid 90s, Beej got tired of all his friends asking him how to do this stuff with networking programming in C, so he put pen to paper on the early World Wide Web and wrote down everything he knew just to get them off his back. Since then, the Guide has expanded significantly, with plenty of examples, and covers IPv6. Inside you'll find such diverse topics as: Sockets programming in the C programming language, client/server, IPv4 and IPv6, data encoding, lots of manual pages rewritten in a friendlier format with examples, and goats! Actually no goats, but goats will be with you in spirit! Beej's Guide to Network Programming is also freely available for PDF download online in US Letter and A4 sizes, in its entirety, and always will be--https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ . The bound version here is provided as a service to those who still prefer the analog printed word. (And to those who want to kick back a few bucks to the author.)},
